# Movie-Recommendation-System-
This project builds a content-based movie recommendation system using Python and machine learning techniques. It analyzes movie metadata — including genres, cast, crew, and keywords — to suggest similar movies based on user input.
Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing of movie metadata

Text vectorization using CountVectorizer

Cosine similarity for movie similarity scoring

Custom recommendation function to find top similar movies

Efficient handling of large movie datasets

Technologies:
Python, pandas, numpy

scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, cosine similarity)

NLTK (for text stemming)

Jupyter Notebook for development & visualization

Perfect for learning natural language processing, recommender systems, and machine learning fundamentals.
